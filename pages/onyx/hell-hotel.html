    <h3>About <span class="colored-text">Hell Hotel</span>:</h3>
    <p>Hell Hotel is a first person horror game developed by <span class="colored-text">ONYX Development</span> using the Unity Game Engine.</p>
    <p>The project was started late summer of 2023 and we have been working on it from time to time.</p>
    <p>We do plan on eventually releasing the game to the public on steam (and possibly console) however we do not have a time release date yet.</p>
