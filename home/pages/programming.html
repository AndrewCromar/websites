            <p>Andrew Arcade is a custom game console running Linux on a Raspberry Pi 5. It is designed to run my own Unity games.</p>
            <p>Version 2 is currently in development. This update focuses on moving from Linux to Android for better native support on ARM architecture. There is no set completion date for Version 2, but progress is being made slowly.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I plan to create a separate website for Andrew Arcade. For now, this page serves as its home.</p>

            <h3>Clean Gmail Chrome Extension</h3>
            <p>
                Clean Gmail is a Chrome extension to clean up the UI of the Gmail website.
                <br>
                Recently, I have been feeling like the Gmail website is full of random stuff that I do not need,
                like the tabs on the left, the tabs on the right, and things in the top bar.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a before and after comparison:</p>

                <div class="image-comparison-handle"></div>
            </div> 
            <p>The way it works is by either removing elements or modifying elements. I get references to everything using class names.</p>
            <p>This project is effectively complete (I won't be working on it anymore).</p>
