        Well it's been a long time since the last tile I made a post but I would like to say that I've been working on a lot of game projects using unity 3d. I had a bug that I was having difficulties fixing so I decided to have a look at old projects. That's when I found my blog site code and wanted to make another post.

        This post won't be too long but I just wanted to let you know how it's been going and that I'm having a wonderful time in the programming community. Anyway I'll be going now. Hopefully I'll post more stuff on this "blog" if that's what you can call it. See you soon! :)
