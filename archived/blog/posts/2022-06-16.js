            I have created many websites in my free time and my main ones I upload to the web.
            Here are some of the websites I have created:
            <br><a href="https://www.andrewcromar.org">www.andrewcromar.org</a>
            <br><a href="https://dev.andrewcromar.org">dev.andrewcromar.org</a>
            <br><a href="https://blog.andrewcromar.org">blog.andrewcromar.org</a>
            <br><a href="https://trio.andrewcromar.org">trio.andrewcromar.org</a>

            <br><br>I have been updating these sites for a while now and my main website (<a href="https://www.andrewcromar.org">www.andrewcromar.org</a>) has had many big updates.
            <br><br>My dev website (<a href="https://dev.andrewcromar.org">dev.andrewcromar.org</a>) is being used where I publish projects I make and it is the site for my dev youtube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdMVFAUNBlR6nfqVjbjHCqg">www.youtube.com/channel/UCdMVFAUNBlR6nfqVjbjHCqg</a>).
            <br><br><a href="https://trio.andrewcromar.org">trio.andrewcromar.org</a> is used for a company my friends and I have created called Trio Productions. We are currently working on a movie!
            <br><br><a href="https://blog.andrewcromar.org">blog.andrewcromar.org</a> is used (as you can tell) as my blog! :)
