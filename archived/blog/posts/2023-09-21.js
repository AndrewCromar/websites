            Valorant suck, I think this for many different reasons and I'm going to start with the penalties. On my computer I can run Valorant but sometimes it randomly crashes, usually when starting the game or when I am loading into a map. These crashes are something that I cannot control and when I crash loading into a game I get dodge penalties. One recent time this happened was about a week ago, I was loading into the map with my friends, we just selected our agents and I hear them say they loaded in, keep in mind I have not loaded in yet, about five minutes go by and then the game crashes. When I relaunch the game I see that I have an hour and a half penalty on unrated and on comp I have a 170 HOUR PENALTY. I just closed the game, uninstalled all Riot things (launcher, Valorant, and the stupid Vangaurd). I plan on not reinstalling Valorant and now I am back into playing Fortnite. So yea thats why I HATE Valorant.
