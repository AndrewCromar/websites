            It's the second day of the site's creation and I've already updated the look and feel.
            The main update is that I've added a random colored background.
            Some of the colors are quite bright so if it's too bright for you, just refresh the page.
            In the future I'll add a clamp to the brightness of the background, so that it does not get too bright that you can't read.
