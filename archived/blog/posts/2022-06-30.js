            In this update I have added a few new features which are listed below.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1] When you hover over a post it will grow in size a bit.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2] When you hover over a post it will get a shadow.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3] When you hover over an image it will do a small shake animation.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This update was not very big but it was a good update.
