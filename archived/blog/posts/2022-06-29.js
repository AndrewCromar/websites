            Today I was playing Fortnite and I was trying to finish all my questions. I got to a hard one where I had to kill Darth Vader. It took me many tries and I finally found a good way to kill him! I'm going to explain the strategy I used in easy steps.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1] First locate the spot where he is going to land his ship.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2] Drop onto one of the chests and get the E-11 Blaster Rifle.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3] Start shooting at the Storm Troopers and knock both of them.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3] Now you can start shooting at Darth Vader. You want to keep continuously shooting at him unless he is blocking your shots. DON'T stop moving, always continue circling him, this will make most of his attacks not hit and it will be easier to kill him.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4] After a few minutes of shooting and circling him, you will kill him. He has a ton of health so killing him might take a while.
