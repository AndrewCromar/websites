            I find that a lot of people say that Fortnite is a crappy game and it sucks. I have to say that those people are wrong, usually they are just bandwagoning with what everyone says. They probably have not even played the game. It really annoys me when I hear people say that because it does not. Fortnite is a fun game and I play it all the time with my friends. So in the future if you see or hear someone say that Fortnite sucks then tell them they are wrong.
