            I have been reading an online course for driving. When I finish the course I can take a permit test and then I could start driving with adults. There are ten units in the course and I am on the ninth one. So I am very close to being able to drive. I am excited because I've been waiting for this day for a long time and I am finally so close to it. Anyway, yes I can almost drive and I'll probably have another post tomorrow.
