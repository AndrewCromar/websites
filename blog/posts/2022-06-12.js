            Well this is the first post on my blog.
            I bet it's not very good looking yet but I'm working on making it look better.
            I'm also working on a way to have a mailing list where you will be updated on any post I make.
            I'll probably change the font and the colors but I'm not sure yet.
            If you want to give me any feedback on what I can do to make it better or easier to use then let me know by emailing me at
            <a href="mailto:me@andrewcromar.org">me@andrewcromar.org</a>.
